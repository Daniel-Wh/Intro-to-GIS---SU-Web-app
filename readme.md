## Introduction to Environmental GIS

This is a web app built for [Southwestern University's](https://www.southwestern.edu/) Environmental Studies department. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was granted an independent study to build a site for the Environment Studies department that works to support the upcoming courses in Geographic Information Systems. The sites guidelines were to include information about the course like lab hours, support staff information, practice labs, and education materials.

## Tutorials

Since TA's will be providing support remotely, I created tutorials to provide real examples of the tools used in ArcMap that the upcoming students will be using in their labs and projects.

## Data Repository

One of the labs I created is a data scavenger hunt. The students will submit their findings directly on the site and the application will store those finding for future student use. This is meant to work as a central repository of data sources for the students as they consider their final projects

## Progress

The site was built desktop first as the students will likely use it while in class but I have made it response to Iphone 6/7/8 plus and smaller screens (portrait - max width of 375px). The site is still in development but is mostly completed and will be live soon.
