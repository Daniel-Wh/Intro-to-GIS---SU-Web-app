## Introduction to Environmental GIS

This is a web app built for [Southwestern University's](https://www.southwestern.edu/) Environmental Studies department. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, I was granted an independent study to build a site for the Environment Studies department that works to support the upcoming courses in Environmental Geographic Information Systems. The sites guidelines were to include information about the course like lab hours, support staff information, practice labs, and educational materials.

## Tutorials

Since TA's will be providing support remotely, I created tutorials to provide real examples of the tools used in ArcMap that the upcoming students will be using in their labs and projects.

## Data Repository

One of the labs I created is a data scavenger hunt. The students will submit their findings directly on the site and the application will store those finding for future student use. This is meant to work as a central repository of data sources for the students as they consider their final projects

## Progress

The site is responsive for all screen sizes and is live. Changes will occur periodically as I add new video tutorials and update content on the site. I want to update the way the content on the home page is generated so I can just add that information to my database instead of updating the copy in the html.
